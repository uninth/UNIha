A word of warning:

Ken Thompson has an automobile which he helped design.
Unlike most automobiles,  it has neither  speedometer,
nor gas gauge,  nor any of the  numerous  idiot light-
swhich plague the modern driver.

Rather,  if the driver  makes  any mistake, agiant "?"
lights up in the center of the dashboard. 

The experienced driver,  he says,  will  usually  know
what's wrong.

You are root on a system designed by Ken Thompson and
you are on your own.
