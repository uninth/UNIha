This version is 1.0 and has been tested and runs on GAiA  release
R76, R77.10, R77.20 and R77.30  and should  work on all later R77
versions.

UNIha is short for UNI-C simple high availability for Check Point
firewall-1. The first version was written in 1996 for  HP-UX  and
Solaris long before Check Point or other came with a working high
availability solution.

The original  version  was made by Niels Thomas Haugård and Kjeld 
Knudsen, UNI-C, later work contributed by Søren Hornstrup.

Current version is by Niels Thomas Haugård
